Reconsider naming of TokenStream methods.
	Information hiding --> readLeft, readRight, unreadLeft, unreadRight
	
Allow lone semicolons in grammar?
	
Make traversing parseTree more data hidden

Output to assembly
	Aliases and pulling/pushing from stack only when necessary
Can make firstTerminalsAndPatterns and follow do the work of the NonTerminal constructor?
Make Token prettier :'-(
Should be able to pass EXPR as argument in made-up language
TokenStream.peek should return EOF if no tokens, not EMPTY

boolean operators (&& || !)
Combine backend functions into NonTerminal rule declarations? if possible and is clean
Build basic readme. Make repository public.
Better lexical and parse failure messages?

SymbolTable types are a little strange.

Long term
	Scope?
	Type checking for addition - Adding strings - Subtracting strings...? i.e. type checking
	Read from file
	
Not important
	Fix the double indent in python compile for if / then
